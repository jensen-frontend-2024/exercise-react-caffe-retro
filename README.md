### Scetch

You must imitate the sketch as much as you can. Do not use your own images and fonts, but use the attached material, follow the look in the video and the instructions in this exercise description. The built-in CSS color `darkred` is a good color for this exercise.

The different images, fonts, texts and video are available in the asssets folder.

### Intructions

- The website must be build with React and ViteJS.
- The website must have three section components.
- Every section component should fill an entire window.
- Every section component should have a header, texts and background images according to the scetch. Try to make components that can be reused across the section components. _( Resuability is hard without the concept of props, skip the 'resuing' part until you know about props)_
- There must be a menu component with links to the different sections.
- Every background image should cover its entire section.
- The website should have as many semantic elements as possible.
- The menu should be fixed to the top of the window at all time.
